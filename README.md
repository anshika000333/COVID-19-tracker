#  COVID-19 Data Tracker

This project is a data analysis and visualization dashboard for COVID-19 using real-time data sourced from **Our World in Data (OWID)**. It highlights trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries and over time.

## Project Overview

- Extracted and cleaned COVID-19 data using **Pandas**
- Analyzed global and country-level trends
- Visualized insights with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- Identified key insights like peak waves, case fatality rates, and country comparisons
